###How to Use

In order to receive a file, click on `Create New Receiver` button. A port number will be assigned to your machine. Anybody who has this port number and IP of your machine can send any file to your machine within LAN (Local Area Network).

In order to send a file to another machine, we must know the IP and port number of the corresponding machine. Fill the fields of the Code-Share pane with the required information and press `Send` button to send code to the target machine. In order to receive files, the target machine must open server by using `Create New Receiver` button.
